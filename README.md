# YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project is designed to provide users with the ability to access, store, and analyze data from various YouTube channels. Leveraging powerful tools like SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, the project delivers a seamless application for retrieving, saving, and querying YouTube channel and video data.

Tools and Libraries Used
This project utilizes the following key components:

Streamlit
Streamlit is employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly UI. It enables users to interact with the application easily, facilitating data retrieval and analysis tasks.

Python
Python, known for its simplicity and versatility, is the primary programming language used for developing the entire application. Python handles data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.

Google API Client
The googleapiclient library is used to interact with YouTube's Data API v3. This allows the application to retrieve vital information, including channel details, video statistics, and comments. The Google API Client simplifies access to YouTube's vast data resources programmatically.

MongoDB
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers a flexible and scalable solution for storing structured and unstructured data. As a document database, it uses a JSON-like format to store information, making it ideal for handling dynamic data schemas.

PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source relational database management system. Known for its reliability and powerful SQL features, PostgreSQL serves as the primary platform for storing and managing structured data in this project, supporting complex queries and analysis.

YouTube Data Scraping and Ethical Considerations
When scraping YouTube content, it is essential to approach the process ethically and responsibly. This includes respecting YouTube's terms of service, securing proper authorization, and complying with data protection regulations. The data gathered should be handled with care, ensuring privacy and confidentiality, and avoiding misuse. Additionally, it's important to consider the potential impact on YouTubeâ€™s community, aiming for a balanced and sustainable approach. By adhering to these ethical guidelines, we can responsibly derive valuable insights from YouTube data.

Required Libraries
The following Python libraries are necessary for this project:

googleapiclient.discovery
streamlit
psycopg2
pymongo
pandas
Features
